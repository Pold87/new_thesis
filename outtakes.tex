\section{Experiment -- Texton-based Approach for Guidance, Motion tracking system for Validation}
\label{sec:experiment-6}

In this experiment, the navigation was entirely performed by the
presented algorithm, except for height control, which was based on the
sonar measurements. A predefined route was created beforehand and the
difference between the desired path and actual path was determined,
using the motion tracking system for recording the data.
